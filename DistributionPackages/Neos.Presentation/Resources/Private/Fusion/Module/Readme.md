# Modules

Modules are the closest thing to content components in the Presentation package. They use the full width space and can be used next to each other.

Please only use inline Tailwind and Alpinejs in the Modules folder, besides the Atoms and Molecules. 
If you create something more complex, then you probably need to create Molecules or sometimes even Organisms.
