# Neos Presentation

This package contains presentational components for neos.io sites.

## Guidelines

### CSS

We primarily use [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/) for styling.
It should cover at least 80% of the styling needs.
Only use custom CSS for advanced/complex stylings.

### JS/TS

We use inline [AlpineJS](https://alpinejs.dev/) for simple interactions and Alpine.data() for more complex interactions.
